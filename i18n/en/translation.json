  "mortgage intro": "A mortgage is a loan for buying houses or apartments. It has three important parts: the Loan Term, Deposit Percentage, and Interest Rate. The loan term decides how long you have to pay back the money, affecting your monthly payments and the extra money (interest) you pay. The deposit is money you pay upfront to make the loan smaller. - in most countries a certain deposit percentage is mandatory. The interest rate is a fee for borrowing money; you pay a bit of it every month - interest reduces each month as you owe less and less (but the monthly payment stays the same)."
